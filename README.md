GMELON contract

GMELON is how we greet each other everyday.

Forked from first ever GM (good morning) token, which was 100% fully fair launched with no presale, no white list, and no team tokens. 50% of the supply was burnt at launch and the remaining 50% of the supply was added to liquidity on uniswap and locked with team finance.

$GMELON was created to pay respects to Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, who has been a staunch supporter of everything crypto.

1% of every transaction amount will be sent directly to Elon Musk wallet.
